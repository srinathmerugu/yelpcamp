# Yelp Camp


## Summary

YelpCamp is a RESTful web-app I made to get more comfortable using Node.js, MongoDB and express. 

**This website is not intended for public use. Please note that all campground ratings are randomly generated and some of the data is fake (randomly generated).**

YelpCamp allows users to:

- Search for Campgrounds by Country
- Signup with an email address, facebook, or google
- Post Campgrounds
- Rate Campgrounds
- Comment on Campgrounds
